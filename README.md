# Multi-Agent AI Workflow Demo

This project is a demonstration of a modular multi-agent AI system designed to coordinate autonomous agents to complete a user-facing task: writing a short article based on a given topic.

Created by **Heidi** as part of an AI Workflow Engineer application.

## Features
- **Agent 1: Research** – Gathers simulated relevant information about a given topic.
- **Agent 2: Verification** – Fact-checks and verifies the collected content.
- **Agent 3: Writing** – Writes the final article in a clear and user-friendly style.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Modular code structure for clarity and control
